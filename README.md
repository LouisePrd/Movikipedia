# Movikipedia Study Case - React

The goal of this project is to create a simple movie browsing app in React.

### Interface
The interface should include at least 3 elements:
- The list of available movies
- A search bar
- Details concerning a movie

### Requirements
You must use React to make this app. 

### Data
The movie app should use data coming from themovieDB API:
- Create an account on https://www.themoviedb.org/
- Generate an API key (as described here : [The Movie Database API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) )
- Connect your app to that API

### Functionality
- The user should be able to select movies listed on the left and filter that list using the search bar
- The search bar should leverage the API's search function instead of filtering the initial list
